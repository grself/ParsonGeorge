# The Parson George Website

This is the source code for the Parson George website (http://www.parsongeorge.com). 

I use GitHub to permit versioning and the potential to revert back to an earlier version 
of the site if I post something that needs to be changed. I created the Github repository 
after my brief move to a different tour owner and later had to revert back to 
the Ghost and Murder Tour.

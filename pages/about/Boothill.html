    <p class="bg-note">Note: This page concerns Boothill&#39;s history. For
    information about Boothill&#39;s paranormal activity visit <a href=
    "../sites/Boothill.html"><em>Top 13 -- Boothill</em></a>.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-9">
        <p>This is among my favorite spots in Tombstone since the stories about
        the folks buried here are quite interesting and the Graveyard after
        dark is always very peaceful and calm. Boothill graveyard was opened in
        1878, the year that the city was founded, and was simply called <em>The
        Tombstone Cemetery</em>. The city fathers closed the cemetery in 1884
        when they opened <em>The City Cemetery</em> on Allen Street. The old
        cemetery was pretty much abandoned for nearly 40 years before Walter
        Meyer of the Tombstone school district organized a Boy Scout troop to
        clean up the cemetery and the city attempted to contact relatives of
        those buried here to verify their locations. In the 1940&#39;s, Emmet
        Nunnelley was given permission by the city to operate a new concession
        at Boothill in exchange for his work to restore the cemetery, properly
        mark the graves, and generally clean up the brush and weeds.</p>

        <p>The name &quot;Boothill&quot; had been used for cemeteries
        throughout old west boom towns for many years and, more importantly, it
        had become a staple of dime novels and newspaper articles during much
        of the early 20th century. Thus, it is no mystery why the Tombstone
        city cemetery was renamed <em>Boothill Graveyard</em> in the 1920&#39;s
        due, largely, to the growing expectations of tourists who wanted to
        visit that &quot;Wild West&quot; location in Tombstone. The name was
        intended to symbolize those buried there who had &quot;died with their
        boots on,&quot; a reference to their unexpected deaths.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-3">

    <p>Often, the guests visiting Tombstone expect to see gamblers and
    gunslingers buried in Boothill and they are surprised to learn that we also
    have the innocent buried here. It is important to keep in mind that this
    was our city cemetery and anyone who died in Tombstone would be buried
    here, the good and bad alike. For example, local legend has it that the
    first person buried here was Eva Waters, who was only three months old when
    she died of scarlet fever. Near her grave is that of Hilly Hickson, a boy
    who broke his leg from a fall off of a pair of stilts and died a few weeks
    later of a blood infection. On the other hand, the three men killed at the
    Gunfight on Freemont Street (commonly called &quot;The Gunfight at the OK
    Corral&quot;) and the seven men legally hanged behind the Courthouse are
    buried here, along with their peers who are far from innocent.</p>

    <p>The graves are not organized by any particular system; rather, people
    seemed to be buried wherever there was space when they died. However, the
    seven men legally hanged on the gallows behind the courthouse are all
    buried in one corner of the graveyard and another corner contains the
    graves of Chinese workers who lived in this town at that time. Also, a
    <a href="Jewish.html">Jewish cemetery</a> is located just off of the back
    corner of the graveyard.</p>

    <p>I suppose that the question I&#39;m asked most often is, &quot;Is
    Boothill a real cemetery?&quot; Yes, it is a real cemetery. After about
    1890, the silver industry was dying out and Tombstone, itself, was in
    danger of becoming a ghost town. During that time, Boothill was abandoned
    and photographs taken in the early 1920&#39;s show the area as nothing more
    than the desert floor with a few grave markers scattered about. Unlike
    other boom towns that survived to the modern era, like Dodge City, KS, the
    citizens of Tombstone never did anything to actively destroy the cemetery
    location and build on top of that ground. In the 1920&#39;s the city made
    an effort to reconstruct Boothill so they pored over old records,
    interviewed &quot;old-timers&quot; and people who had relatives buried
    here, and even pounded a long steel rod into the ground to try to locate
    caskets. The tireless efforts of many people throughout the mid 20th
    century restored Boothill as much as possible. So, yes, it is a real
    cemetery.</p>

    <p>However, there are a few known &quot;fake&quot; graves in Boothill,
    placed there over the years by the city in an effort to appease
    tourists:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lester Moore</strong>. His epitaph reads: &quot;Here lies
      Lester Moore, Four slugs from a .44, No Les No more.&quot; This is,
      without doubt, the most famous grave in Boothill. Unfortunately, there is
      no evidence of anyone named Lester Moore being killed in a gunfight or
      even living in the Tombstone area, nor of the burial location of the
      other man supposedly also killed in the gunfight, Hank Dunstan. Finally,
      the date of this incident is not known though some people report the year
      as 1880. All-in-all, this grave seems to be a fabrication added to
      Boothill for the sake of tourism.</li>

      <li><strong>George Johnson</strong>. His epitaph reads: &quot;Here lies
      George Johnson, hanged by mistake 1882. He was right, we were wrong, but
      we strung him up and now he&#39;s gone.&quot; It is not possible to know
      if there was actually a George Johnson who lived in Tombstone in the
      1880&#39;s, but there is no record of a lynching, or other untimely
      death, of anyone by that name. The most probable conclusion is that this
      clever epitaph was added to Boothill for the tourists.</li>

      <li><strong>John Heath</strong>. He was lynched in Tombstone but his body
      was shipped to his relatives in Terrell, TX. The February 28, 1884, issue
      of the Kaufman Sun published in Terrell, TX, printed this notice:
      &quot;John Heath was taken by a mob from jail and hung in Tombstone. His
      remains were brought to Terrell and interred yesterday. He was a
      notorious gambler, burglar, horse and cattle thief.&quot; Thus, while
      there was a John Heath who was lynched in Tombstone, the grave with his
      name in Boothill is empty.</li>

      <li><strong>Thomas Harper</strong>. He was actually hanged and buried in
      Tucson, not Tombstone. He supposedly killed John Talliday in a card game.
      Both Harper and Talliday have been listed as buried in Boothill by
      different sources, but since Harper is not in Boothill it is doubtful
      that Talliday is here.</li>

      <li><strong>Neves Deron</strong>. This grave was also listed as
      &quot;Fiderico Doran&quot; but is likely actually &quot;Federico
      Duran.&quot; The legend is that Duran robbed a train in Mexico and
      escaped to the Tombstone area. A friend, Guadalupe Robles, let Duran hide
      at his wood-cutting camp in the Whetstone mountains. Then, John
      Slaughter, the Cochise County Sheriff, found the hideout and shot Duran
      while attempting to capture him. In reality, Duran was captured in Mexico
      by Mexican authorities and executed there by a firing squad. He was not
      killed in Cochise County, Slaughter had nothing to do with his death, and
      he is not buried in Boothill. This also casts doubt on the grave of
      Guadalupe Robles in Boothill who was said to have also been shot by John
      Slaughter during the Duran arrest. Robles may be buried in Boothill, and
      he may have died of a gunshot by Slaughter, but his death is not related
      to that of Duran.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following table lists all of the people buried at Boothill in
    Tombstone, AZ. As I learn new things about the folks in Boothill I&#39;ll
    keep this page updated.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The table can be sorted by clicking on any of the words in the header
      row.</li>

      <li>The locations are by row and then the position in the row, starting
      with &quot;.01&quot; on the south end of the row (nearest the parking
      lot). So, <em>Rodriguez Petron</em> is on Row #1 and Position #01.</li>

      <li>There are 74 graves in this list with &quot;Unknown&quot; for a last
      name. In the 1880&#39;s, Tombstone, like most mining boom towns, had a
      large transient population. Since no one carried identification in those
      days, if people died who could not be identified it was common to bury
      them as &quot;Unknown.&quot;</li>

      <li>There are two piles of rock in the graveyard that appear to be graves
      but do not have any markers. They are indicated in this list by the word
      &quot;Unmarked&quot; for the last name. I do not know if these are
      actually graves or just rocks piled up to look like a grave.</li>

      <li>There are a number of names with no locations. (These can be found by
      sorting on the &quot;Loc&quot; column.) These are people that we believe
      are buried here due to family records but we do not have any idea where
      their graves may be located. It seems likely that at least a few of the
      &quot;Unknown&quot; graves belong to these people, but we will never know
      for certain.</li>

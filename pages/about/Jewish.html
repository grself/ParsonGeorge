    <h1>Jewish Memorial</h1>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>What is today the Boothill Graveyard was opened in 1878 as just the
    <em>Tombstone Cemetery</em>. It was closed in 1884 because it was full and
    a new cemetery was opened. The cemetery was renamed <em>Boothill
    Graveyard</em> in the 1920&#39;s to appeal to the growing tourism business.
    (You can find more information about the <a href="Boothill.html">history of
    Boothill</a> on my site.)</p>

    <p>It is not known how many Jews lived in Tombstone in those early days,
    but there was a &quot;Tombstone Hebrew Association&quot; so it seems likely
    that there was a sizable population. In fact, Abraham Hyman Emanuel, a
    Jewish mine superintendent, was the Tombstone mayor from 1896 to 1900. In
    those early days, Jewish citizens were not buried in the city cemetery.
    It&#39;s not clear if that is because there was some sort of law against
    permitting Jews to be buried at the cemetery though that doesn&#39;t seem
    likely given all of the other types of people buried there. One local
    historian told me that the Jews, themselves, did not want to be buried in a
    Gentile cemetery and preferred to be buried with their own people. Whatever
    the reason, the Jewish cemetery was located just down the hill off of the
    northeast corner of Boothill.</p>

    <p>The Jewish cemetery was not maintained and fell into complete disrepair
    over the decades. There are no records of who, or even how many, were
    buried there. In the late 1970&#39;s the cemetery was visited by Judge C.
    Lawrence Huerta when Tombstone author Al Turner showed the site to him and
    his Jewish visitors from Maryland, Israel Rubin and his family. At that
    time it was defined only by a crumbling adobe brick wall, now only about
    four-feet high. The approximately 2500-square foot (50 feet by 50 feet)
    burial ground was generally unnoticed for more than 100 years.</p>

    <p>Huerta, a full-blooded Yaqui Indian from Tucson, was spiritually
    affected when Israel Rubin recited the traditional Kaddish prayer at the
    abandoned site. He was moved to restore the now-desolate graveyard in
    memory of those who lay there and all the departed who are now forgotten.
    &quot;I&#39;m an American Indian who spent many years in Washington, D.C.,
    working on behalf of my people,&quot; he says. &quot;There the Rubin family
    made me a part of them. The state of the Jewish cemetery at Boothill moved
    me deeply. A burial place is sacred to my people, and I wanted this place
    to be treated with the respect it once had. In honoring my Jewish brothers
    I feel I am also honoring the lost and forgotten bones of my own people who
    lay where they fell when the west was being settled.&quot;</p>

    <p>In March 1983 the Tombstone City Council approved Huerta&#39;s
    restoration efforts. The Jewish Friendship Club of Green Valley, Arizona,
    got involved and they cleaned the site, built a wrought iron fence to
    protect the remaining wall, and erected a simple monument to commemorate
    the Jewish pioneers who settled this land.</p>

    <p>The monument stands on a platform faced with rock from nearby silver
    mines. It bears on its east and west sides the Star of David. On the south
    side is a HoHoKam Indian sun-symbol -- the word meaning &quot;those who
    vanished&quot; in the Papago Indian language. Inside the monument are
    donated items: soil from Israel, a yarmulke, a menorah, a Kaddish cup,
    prayer and hymn books, and a Yaqui bowl containing several unspecified
    native American religious artifacts. It was hoped that those who lie there
    can &quot;dwell in the house of the Lord forever.&quot; The flames of the
    specially designed &quot;menorah&quot; atop the monument spell
    &quot;Shalom,&quot; Peace, symbolizing the hope that all who share Mother
    Earth can dwell together in harmony. Appropriate ceremonies marked the
    dedication of the monument in February 1984 and today Temple Kol Hamidbar,
    the only Jewish Temple in Cochise County, has an annua1 memorial service at
    the Boothill Jewish Cemetery.</p>

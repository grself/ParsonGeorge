        <p>I have been leading both walking and motorized ghost tours in
        Tombstone since the summer of 2009. During that time, I have amassed a
        wealth of information about paranormal activity in Tombstone by simply
        talking to both local folks and guests in town about the things that
        they observe. I have also gathered over 400 photographs of paranormal
        activity in Tombstone from guests over the years and I share the best
        of those stories and photos on this site, at <a href=
        "https://www.facebook.com/TombstoneGhostTour/">my Facebook page</a>,
        and during the tour. Additionally, I enjoy writing traditional
        &quot;campfire&quot; <a href="../stories/index.html">ghost stories</a>
        and I share one of those with the group near the end of every tour.</p>

        <p>While I am, truly, a minister, I chose my character&#39;s name in
        homage to George Whitwell Parsons. Mr. Parsons was a pioneer and
        businessman who moved to Tombstone in 1880 and remained for about 10
        years. The remarkable thing about Mr. Parsons was that he kept a
        journal and recorded the daily activity of Tombstone&#39;s common
        folks. His journal gives historians a keen insight into the life of a
        &quot;normal&quot; person in a mining boomtown like Tombstone. As an
        example, his entry for October 27, 1881, the day after the Gunfight on
        Fremont Street (later called the Gunfight at the OK Corral) starts:
        &quot;Snow this morning. Windy and extremely cold and
        disagreeable...&quot; It was this chance comment that let us know that
        the weather was unseasonably cold during that gunfight, not warm like
        may be expected in the desert or depicted in movies. If you wonder what
        he had to say about that gunfight, he was out of town attending to
        business at a mine several miles away, but here are his words from the
        next day:</p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          At Charleston we dined by invitation of H and reached Tombstone about
          five o&#39;clock. Much excitement in town and people apprehensive and
          scary. A bad time yesterday when Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp, with
          Doc Holliday, had a street fight the two McLaurys and Bill Clanton
          and Ike, all but the latter being killed, and W and M Earp wounded.
          Desperate men and a desperate encounter. Bad blood has been brewing
          some time and I was not surprised at the outbreak. It is only a
          wonder it has not happened before. A raid is feared upon the town by
          the cowboys and measures have been taken to protect life and
          property. The &quot;Stranglers&quot; were out in force and showed
          sand. My cowboy appearance and attire was not in keeping with the
          excited mind. Loud talking, or talking in groups, was thought out of
          place. Had to laugh at some of the nervousness. It has been a bad
          scare and the worst is not yet over some think. (&quot;A Tenderfoot
          in Tombstone,&quot; p 188.)
        </blockquote>

        <p>The &quot;Stranglers&quot; Mr. Parsons mentioned was likely a
        vigilante group. The <em>Daily Nugget</em>, a local newspaper that was
        friendly toward the cowboys, called the <em>Epitaph</em>, the other
        newspaper that was friendly toward the Earps, the &quot;Daily
        Strangler.&quot; Since the editor of the <em>Epitaph</em>, John Clum,
        was an advocate of vigilantism it is likely that he supported a
        vigilante organization that became known as &quot;The Stranglers&quot;
        among the citizens of Tombstone.</p>

        <p>On tour days I am often found wandering the streets of Tombstone in
        the hours before the tour. I enjoy chatting with guests who are
        visiting Tombstone so please say &quot;Hi&quot; if you happen to see me
        when you visit town.</p>

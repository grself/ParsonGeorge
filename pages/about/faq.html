    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>I&#39;m asked a lot of different questions on my tour and I use this
    page to record those answers for folks who are not able to actually visit
    Tombstone and take my tour in person.</p>

    <h2>What Are Ghosts?</h2>

    <h3>The Traditional Theory</h3>

    <p>There are many different conjectures about ghosts, but the most common
    thought is that a ghost is the spirit of a departed person that has been
    somehow trapped between this plane of existence and the next. I&#39;m not
    sure why spirits would be trapped, but this explanation has been accepted
    for centuries. In general, there are two different types of ghosts, and
    Tombstone has an abundance of both:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intelligent</strong>. An &quot;intelligent&quot; haunting is
      a ghost that seems to know something about its own state and what is
      going on in the environment. It often moves around objects, like
      furniture, rather than through them and seems to have a purpose for
      appearing. These types of ghosts frequently contact humans by using a
      medium and have a message for the living. One special type of intelligent
      haunting is a <em>poltergeist</em>, which is a ghost that can physically
      interact with the environment and is often somewhat mischievous. I
      occasionally hear stories about things that have been moved in an
      unoccupied room, like guests who tell me that keys or shoes or something
      were moved in their rooms while they are out, but poltergeist activity is
      rare in Tombstone.</li>

      <li>
        <strong>Residual</strong>. In contrast to an intelligent haunting, a
        residual haunting is a ghost that returns periodically and performs the
        same action on each visit, something like a film being repeated over
        and over. In contrast to an intelligent haunting, a residual ghost will
        move directly through walls, vehicles, or whatever else is in the way,
        as if the ghost is not aware of its surroundings and is simply reliving
        something from the past. Tombstone has a number of well-known residual
        hauntings and I tell stories about a few of the more common ones during
        my tour. As an example, there are reports of an elderly woman dressed
        in clothes from the 1940&#39;s who is sometimes seen at dawn standing
        at the edge of <a href=
        "https://www.google.com/maps/@31.7133041,-110.0692743,18.25z" target=
        "_blank">Allen Street between Second and Third</a>. She is only there
        for a few minutes and simply looks up and down Allen Street several
        times, as if she is waiting for a ride to go somewhere. No one seems to
        know who this woman is or what she is doing here, but when she shows up
        she tends to startle people who are not expecting to see a person there
        at that time of day.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Modern Theory</h3>

    <p>Ground-breaking research is being conducted in both physics and
    meta-physics which informs our understanding of ghosts. Tools available to
    science today, like the CERN nuclear research laboratory and the Hubble
    telescope, were not even imagined just a few decades ago and they
    significantly improve our understanding of the paranormal. We are, truly,
    entering a &quot;Golden Age&quot; of paranormal research that has never
    before been possible.</p>

    <p>One promising new field of inquiry involves the possibility of parallel
    universes. One interesting idea is that there can be an infinite number of
    universes that are very similar to our own but, due to the <em>Butterfly
    Effect</em>, have evolved just slightly differently. In those universes
    closest to our own the difference may be minimal, such as how people dress
    or their form of government. Those universes would have, in turn, parallel
    equivalents that would be slightly different from them. If travelers could
    somehow hop from one universe to the next they would find that each
    universe would become more and more bizarre when compared to our own.</p>

    <p>If parallel universes are eventually proven to be true then an exciting
    new idea about ghosts becomes possible. Perhaps a ghost is nothing more
    than the momentary interaction between our own universe and the closest
    parallel. That interaction could be sensed as a fleeting light in an
    observer&#39;s peripheral vision or, if the interaction is much stronger,
    it could be sensed as a spectral shape that becomes visible to a wide group
    of people. Of course, there are a wide variety of other interactions
    possible, depending on the quality of the connection between the universes.
    The interacting universe would be our closest adjacent one and it would be
    very similar to our own, with, maybe, just one weird difference, and that
    would be the source of confusion for people experiencing the interaction.
    For example, the interacting universe theory could explain why a
    poltergeist would move someone&#39;s keys if in that parallel world keys
    belong in the sink or refrigerator or somewhere &quot;strange&quot; to
    us.</p>

    <p>Developing this concept even further, perhaps death is nothing more than
    the movement of a spirit from this to a nearby parallel universe where it
    starts a new existence. In that case, if the spirit has an urgent message
    for those left behind it would attempt to get that message back to this
    universe and that could explain things like mediums who communicate with
    departed loved ones. Perhaps our lives are merely an eternal shuffling
    between multi-verses and some of those would be heavenly while others would
    be hellish. This understanding of the grand cosmos would explain many
    religious and secular experiences, including such wide-ranging phenomena as
    angelic appearances, extra-sensory perception, and unidentified flying
    objects.</p>

    <p>At any rate, parallel universes may not be the best explanation of the
    presence of ghosts and other paranormal activity but it is at least an area
    that deserves more thought and investigation.</p>

    <h2>How Do Ghosts Materialize?</h2>

    <p>Of course, the exact mechanism for a materialization is not known for
    certain, but I have been sent so many photos over the years that I am able
    to speculate that ghosts go through four stages as they materialize.
    I&#39;ve determined the order for these stages by simply counting the
    number of photos that I receive for each stage. I assume that all ghosts
    start at stage one but then many lose the energy needed to finish the
    entire process. Therefore, I expect the most photos from stage one and then
    a decreasing number of photos for each of the remaining stages. If that is
    true, then the following is the most likely progression for a ghost from
    immaterial to corporeal.</p>

      <div class="row img-right">
        <div class="col-lg-10">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Orb</strong>. An orb looks like a globe or ball on a
            photograph. Normally, an orb has some sort of visible internal
            structure, which is how I can differentiate orbs from simple dust
            particles (there is more information about orbs in other answers on
            this page). The purpose of an orb is to gather energy so the ghost
            can materialize and when guests on my tour start to get photos with
            a lot of orbs someone frequently complains that their battery is
            about dead since the orbs will drain the energy from that battery.
            Oddly, when the trolley leaves that immediate area those batteries
            tend to return to full strength. Because orbs gather energy, they
            are present throughout the entire materialization process so the
            ghost is able to move from one stage to the next. Orbs are very
            common in Tombstone and many of my guests are able to capture
            photos of orbs during my tour. Guests also frequently send me
            photos of orbs that they took during their stay in Tombstone though
            not while they were on my tour. The accompanying photograph shows
            several great orbs at Boothill Graveyard.</li>

        <div class="col-lg-10">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Plasma</strong>. A plasma looks like smoke or fog on a
            photograph. Typically, there are orbs mixed in with the plasma
            since the ghost continues to absorb the massive amounts of energy
            it needs to move to the next stage. A plasma will swirl around like
            smoke but, unlike smoke, will swirl very slowly. As it swirls, a
            body part, like a hand or face, may begin to take shape. That part
            will only stay for a short time and will then be engulfed by the
            plasma and disappear. In the accompanying photo, a plasma is
            visible in the lower right corner. Many people who have seen this
            photo believe that the plasma resembles a walking man, which may
            mean that the apparition will materialize in that form.</li>

      <div class="row img-right">
        <div class="col-lg-10">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vortex</strong>. A vortex looks like a streak of light
            on a photograph and there is normally an orb or two mixed in with
            it since the orbs must gather energy throughout the entire
            materialization process. A vortex can be differentiated from simple
            camera movement because other items in the photo are in sharper
            focus while the vortex is more blurry. As the energy is gathered
            the vortex becomes longer and more sharply defined. It seems that a
            vortex starts as a nebulous plasma, but as the energy increases the
            vortex begins to coalesce into a smaller mass and become more human
            in appearance. The vortex in the accompanying photo is certainly
            more organized than a plasma but still not very well defined so it
            must be near the mid-point of this phase. If the energy level
            remains adequate a vortex will evolve into the next stage, an
            apparition.</li>

        <div class="col-lg-10">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Apparition</strong>. An apparition takes many forms on
            a photograph, but they normally have an identifiable human, or even
            animal, shape. We normally think of ghosts as white, but an
            apparition can be in muted colors, shades of gray, or even a shadow
            man. Because this stage requires so much spectral energy,
            apparitions do not often appear for a long period of time; they
            tend to be present for only a few minutes and then revert to stage
            three or vanish altogether. The accompanying photograph shows a
            window at the courthouse with a man looking out of the top right
            pane. The ghost is rather hard to see, but that is the way ghosts
            are. Perhaps this ghost is near the end of its visible time so is a
            bit weaker.</li>

    <p>While it is difficult to quantify the amount of paranormal activity in
    any one spot, I&#39;ve used two types of evidence to establish the order
    for my &quot;Top Locations.&quot;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First is the number of photographs that guests have sent me for any
      one location. While there are many variables that would account for a
      difference in the number of photographs guests send me from various
      locations, I use that count as a simple and easy-to-understand indicator
      of the amount of paranormal activity around town. To be honest, it could
      be that a place like the <a href=
      "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ed+Schiefflin+Monument/@31.7280231,-110.1104656,14z"
        target="_blank">Schieffelin Monument</a> has a &quot;ghost party&quot;
        every night but guests do not generally visit that location to take
        photographs, especially after dark; however, using a photograph count
        to establish the Top Locations seems to be reasonable.
      </li>

      <li>Second is local tradition. For example, I have no photographs of
      paranormal activity at the San Jose house but there are many stories
      consistently told about that location and it is widely regarded as
      haunted by the local citizens so I rated it as a Top Location in my
      listing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why does Boothill Graveyard seem to have &quot;darker&quot; phenomena
    than other sites?</h2>

    <p>Boothill Graveyard seems to have more shadow men, dark plasmas, and
    other dark phenomena than other locations around Tombstone and even haunted
    locations elsewhere that I have investigated, and it is reasonable to
    wonder why. Frankly, I do not know for sure but I suspect that it concerns
    the flow of energy around a specific psychic phenomenon (or
    &quot;ghost&quot;). It would seem reasonable to assume that dark phenomena
    are rapidly absorbing energy from the environment while light phenomena are
    emitting energy. Extending this concept just a bit would lead me to believe
    that the spirits in Boothill are absorbing energy while those elsewhere are
    emitting energy. But, again, why? My best guess is that Boothill Graveyard
    is the final location for human remains and perhaps the spirits attached to
    those remains are absorbing all available energy as they attempt to move on
    to the next phase of their existence while spirits elsewhere are
    comfortable with their existence so they able to shed excess energy they
    may have gathered in the form of light. If that is true, then the spirits
    at Boothill Graveyard would tend to be more restless and anxious than the
    spirits elsewhere and that could certainly account for the amount of
    activity recorded there. One of the guests on my tour once suggested that
    perhaps Boothill has very little available energy for ghosts to use so they
    absorb all of it (leaving a dark impression) while other locations in town
    may have a lot of excess energy available so those ghosts can afford to
    shed energy rather freely. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between these
    two explanations, but there does seem to be a difference in the paranormal
    activity at Boothill when compared to other Tombstone locations.</p>

    <h2>How can you tell the difference between an orb and just dust?</h2>

    <div class="row img-right">
      <div class="col-lg-10">
        <p>The best way to differentiate between orbs and lesser artifacts in
        photographs is to look for structure. Some orbs seem to have a
        gear-like structure while others seem to have a web of some sort. The
        orb photograph in the &quot;How Do Ghosts Materialize?&quot; section
        above shows internal concentric circles, about like a gear pattern of
        some sort. On the other hand, the photograph on the right shows several
        orbs with an internal web structure. It is natural to wonder why some
        orbs display concentric circles and others display web-like structures.
        My best thought is that as an orb matures and gathers energy it is
        eventually able to organize its internal structure into multiple
        well-designed forms while a more web-like structure is a less mature
        orb that is still simply attempting to gather energy. In other words,
        orbs like those in the &quot;How Do Ghosts Materialize?&quot; section
        above are more mature and contain more energy than orbs like those
        displayed in the image on the right. (Click on each of the images to
        see a larger version.) In general, though, an orb will display some
        sort of internal structure while dust does not.</p>

    <h2>Are the photographs faked?</h2>

    <p>Since October 2009, guests have sent me just over 450 photographs (as of
    July 2018). It is not possible for me to verify the veracity of any of
    those photographs; however, I would point out the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is no incentive for a guest to send me a fake photograph. I
      only use a few photographs on my tour and display about another 50 on
      this website so most of the photographs guests send me are stored in my
      archive. Moreover, I do not pay anyone for the photos they send. Thus,
      there is no fame, money, or other incentive to spend a lot of time
      &quot;doctoring&quot; a photograph just to send to me. In fact,
      occasionally a guest will send me a photograph with a circle or arrow
      highlighting some object and I always ask that they send me the original,
      un-retouched image since that is what I prefer.</li>

      <li>It would certainly be possible for a guest to create a fantastic
      photograph of the Angel of Death hovering above Tombstone (in fact, that
      would be pretty awesome!), but the photographs that I publicly display
      are similar to dozens that many different guests have sent over the
      years. For example, I have 47 different photographs sent by more than 15
      different guests of orbs in Boothill Graveyard. While it is possible that
      some of those are faked it would not be reasonable to assume that all of
      those guests somehow colluded to send me faked photographs of orbs. I do
      have a few &quot;one-off&quot; photographs that show some sort of
      paranormal activity around Tombstone but I will not display those unless
      I receive other similar photographs from that location. By enforcing my
      own policy of only displaying photographs that are similar to others
      taken by different guests at different times I hope to avoid accidentally
      displaying a fake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Have you ever seen a ghost?</h2>

    <p>It&#39;s natural for guests to wonder about my authenticity -- if I have
    had any paranormal experiences. The fact is that I&#39;ve had paranormal
    experiences since childhood but I learned long ago to simply accept these
    experiences as part of my life and not think that it was anything unusual.
    In fact, I used to think that everyone had the same types of experiences I
    had and that it was just normal to sense ghosts.</p>

    <p>As a young man living in rural Missouri, I found it relaxing to take
    long walks through the woods late at night. There were a number of dirt
    roads and paths criss-crossing the woods around my home and nearly every
    weekend I would take a hike at about midnight down one of those roads. It
    was oddly comforting to me to be in the middle of the woods with the trees
    whispering in the breeze and the occasional owl hooting somewhere in the
    distance. From time to time, I would walk into a cold spot along the trail
    and I somehow knew that there was something happening there. I didn&#39;t
    know much about ghosts at that age so I just called those spots
    &quot;haints&quot; from the stories I had heard the old-timers tell. Today
    I&#39;m much smarter about ghosts and realize that I was in the middle of a
    bunch of orbs that were taking my body heat as a form of energy so a ghost
    could later materialize at that spot.</p>

    <p>For my tours today, I always carry two selenite crystals, a small one on
    a necklace and a larger bar in a leather bag. Selenite, sometimes called
    the &quot;moon stone&quot; due to its pale appearance, is said to help a
    person better understand subconscious impressions, and that seems to be the
    realm of ghosts. Often on my tour I get that same chilly feeling that I had
    on those late night hikes from long ago so I know that there is a spirit in
    the area. On especially lucky nights I also catch the fleeting glimpse of a
    shadow or other shape out of the corner of my eye, though I tend to focus
    my attention more on my guests in the trolley rather than what is going on
    outside. Of course, I also have the second-hand experiences of the stories
    and photos that my guests share with me after the tour.</p>

    <p>So, yes, I&#39;ve had paranormal experiences and believe that I have
    seen several ghosts over my lifetime.</p>

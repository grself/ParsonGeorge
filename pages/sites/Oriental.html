    <h1>Oriental Saloon</h1>

    <h2>Corner of Fifth and Allen Streets</h2>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div id="left_panel" class="col-lg-8">

        <p>This is said to be the fifth most haunted spot in Tombstone.</p>

        <p>The building that used to be the Oriental Saloon is a clothing store
        today, but there are many good stories about the saloon and its
        bartender, &quot;Buckskin&quot; Frank Leslie. It is said that Leslie
        was the fastest, most accurate shot in Tombstone and he was the cause
        of several men ending up in Boothill. Leslie was also blamed for the
        deaths of several other men, like Johnny Ringo, though he always
        maintained that he had nothing to do with them. At any rate, since the
        Oriental could be a violent location I believe that the spirits are
        still restless in this area.</p>

        <p>One evening, I was leading a walking ghost tour through the streets
        of Tombstone and one of my stops was the Oriental Saloon. It had closed
        a couple of hours earlier so I used a small flashlight to look through
        their large store window while I spoke about some of the incidents that
        had taken place there. We started toward our next stop and a small girl
        on our tour tugged on my jacket and asked, &quot;Who was that man in
        there?&quot; I asked her what she meant and she stated, &quot;That man
        standing on the steps in the back of that last place. Who was he?&quot;
        I knew that there was no one in that building at all, but she was so
        convincing that I turned our group around and went back to see who she
        was talking about. I shined my flashlight into the building and she
        said, &quot;There! He&#39;s on those steps drinking something.
        Don&#39;t you see him?&quot; There was no one there, but I just told
        her, &quot;Oh, honey, that&#39;s just a dummy that the store keeps
        there to fool people.&quot; I have no idea who she saw, but we quickly
        walked on to the next stop.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite Tombstone ghost stories is about three women who
        decided to come to Tombstone from a nearby town one Saturday and find
        themselves a ghost. They spent most of the day walking up and down
        Allen Street asking the merchants where they should search for a ghost.
        The most common answer would have been something like, &quot;Walk up
        and down Allen Street at about three o&#39;clock in the morning. Use a
        flashlight and shine it into all of the building, and don&#39;t forget
        to look above the buildings since most of these buildings were two
        stories tall back in the day.&quot;</p>

        <p>That night, the three ladies walked up and down Allen Street several
        times. They were very thorough and shined their flashlights in and
        above all of the buildings. They had seen nothing and decided that
        their trip was a waste. Eventually, even all of the bars closed and
        they stopped in front of the Oriental Saloon and looked down the street
        toward the Birdcage Theatre. They noticed a cowboy wearing a black hat
        and camel-colored duster walking toward them rattling the doorknobs on
        the businesses he passed. These ladies thought that it was a
        Marshal&#39;s Deputy doing a security check on Allen Street and if
        anyone had seen a ghost in Tombstone it would be him. Eventually, the
        deputy checked the doors of a building near the Oriental Saloon and
        then turned and started to cross Allen Street. One of the ladies called
        out, &quot;Excuse me, sir...&quot; Then, the man vanished from the
        middle of the street.</p>

        <p>These three ladies were quite startled and decided that they had
        seen exactly what they had come here to see. Unfortunately, after they
        saw it, they were not so sure that they liked the experience. The next
        day one of them thought to call the Marshal&#39;s office to ask about
        the man doing the security check the night before. She was told that
        the office was short-staffed that night and no one had made security
        checks on Allen Street.</p>

        <p class="bg-info"><strong>Tour Information</strong>: Our trolley stops
        at the corner of Fifth and Allen streets and I tell several stories
        about the history and paranormal activity associated with the buildings
        on this corner, including the Crystal Palace. This was a bloody corner
        of Tombstone and it was here that Virgil Earp was maimed on the night
        of December 28, 1881 -- his assailants were never caught, or even
        identified. It is believed that the paranormal activity experienced
        here is related to at least some of murders that took place on this
        corner.</p>

    <h1>Billy Typhon</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>It was a chilly October afternoon in 1881. Billy Typhon was standing at
    the window of Brown&#39;s Hotel looking down onto Allen Street. Brown&#39;s
    Hotel is above Hafford&#39;s saloon on the corner of Fourth and Allen and
    there was a lot of activity on the street. Billy liked watching the people,
    horses, and wagons that moved up and down the street, he liked the noise of
    the buskers trying to make a few dollars, and even the occasional bar fight
    that spilled out into the street.</p>

    <p>This particular October afternoon, Billy watched three well-dressed men
    calmly walking side-by-side down the middle of Allen Street toward the
    hotel. When the people in the street noticed them they stepped aside and
    let the men pass, like water parting before a boat in a river. Two of the
    men were older and walked confidently toward some appointment, but the
    third was younger and seemed a little more hesitant somehow. They stopped
    almost directly in front of Billy&#39;s window and one of them entered
    Hafford&#39;s saloon. After a few moments, he came back out into the street
    with another man -- so now there were four. They spoke briefly, turned the
    corner onto Fourth Street, and then disappeared from Billy&#39;s view.</p>

    <p>Billy continued to watch the people and traffic on the street below, but
    about ten minutes later he heard some muffled shouts off in the distance.
    Shortly after that, he heard the sharp report of gunfire, a lot of gunfire,
    lasting only a few seconds. He noticed the citizens on the street began to
    run for cover and disappear inside buildings. Even those on horseback or
    driving wagons turned away from that gunfire and rode off as quickly as
    possible. Billy figured that they knew that gunfights often killed innocent
    bystanders and no one wanted to be in the middle of that.</p>

    <p>In only a few minutes, the street had cleared and Billy was amazed that
    the business district full of people hustling to get someplace had changed
    almost instantly into the deserted street of a ghost town. He soon noticed
    three young men walking up the middle of Allen Street away from where the
    gunshots had just rung out. They were alone in the street and walked slowly
    and silently, looking only straight ahead. They were in no particular hurry
    to get anyplace and they ignored the buildings that they passed. It was
    almost like time was standing still.</p>

    <p>They stopped in front of Billy&#39;s window and the closest man slowly
    turned his head and looked directly into Billy&#39;s eyes. The man was pale
    and thin, and his face was frozen into an emotionless mask. Most
    disturbingly, Billy noticed what seemed to be a bullet hole dripping a thin
    trickle of blood down the man&#39;s pale, dusty cheek. Then the man smiled
    and his yellowed teeth peeked from between heat-cracked lips. But there was
    no joy in that smile; rather, it was the sign of a resignation to a fate
    the man did not want.</p>

    <p>Next, a swirling dust devil rose up in the middle of Allen Street
    directly in front of those three men. It grew larger and taller, powered by
    an unfelt wind until it stretched beyond Billy&#39;s gaze far into the sky.
    Slowly, the man farthest from Billy briefly shimmered in the sunlight and
    then, starting from his head and ending at his dusty boots, he vaporized
    into smoke. His essence circled that vortex three times, drawing ever
    closer, until he was sucked its core and vanished forever into the sky
    above. Immediately after that, the second man briefly shimmered in the
    sunlight, disintegrated, circled the vortex, and then vanished like the
    first. Finally, the third man vanished in exactly the same way, except that
    he never took his eyes off of Billy until there were no eyes left. It
    seemed to Billy that just before that last man vanished, his eyes widened
    slightly as he finally recognized Billy&#39;s true identity. Immediately
    after that, the dust devil simply dissipated into the air, the last of it
    swirling briefly in the street before disappearing entirely and leaving no
    trace of any of those men.</p>

    <p>Shortly after that, the citizens began to reappear on Allen Street and
    within a few minutes, it was as alive as before. They seemed to be unaware
    of the three men, the dust devil, or anything that Billy had just
    witnessed. For his part, Billy stood at that window for just a few minutes
    longer, and then he smiled broadly. He briefly shimmered in the sunlight
    and then, starting from his head, vaporized into smoke. He was sucked out
    the window and upwards into an empty sky, unseen by any of the people on
    the street below.</p>

    <p>A guest who entered that hotel room at exactly the same moment that
    Billy vanished reported the strange sound of hooves clattering on the
    floor, a burning stench, and thin wisps smoke swirling out the open
    window.</p>

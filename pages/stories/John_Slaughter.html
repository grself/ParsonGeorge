    <h1>John Slaughter</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>It was February 18, 1922, and Ernest Baker had settled in among the
    boulders in the Dragoon Mountains, hiding from the law after he had robbed
    a traveler just outside Tombstone. He figured that he could wait there for
    a few hours and then head out toward Bisbee and spend the $10 he had
    managed to steal. However, he hadn&#39;t counted on the tenacity of Texas
    John Slaughter.</p>

    <p>Slaughter had been the sheriff of Cochise County many years earlier but
    had since retired to cattle ranching near Douglas. Even though he had not
    been the sheriff for some time, his legend was still discussed by petty
    thieves like Ernest. Slaughter was said to always bring in his man, alive
    or dead, and no one got away.</p>

    <p>While Ernest was waiting there in the Dragoon Mountains, he spotted a
    lone rider headed slowly toward him. He watched that rider for more than an
    hour as he ambled across the desert, stopping from time-to-time to look at
    the tracks in the dirt. He was, though, unmistakably headed straight toward
    Ernest. As the rider got closer, Ernest could make out a distinctive white
    Van Dyke, a hat with a wide, flat brim, and a silken vest under a canvas
    long coat. He realized that it was Texas John Slaughter and wondered what
    the old man was doing out that way.</p>

    <p>Slaughter finally got to the base of the Dragoon Mountains immediately
    under Ernest&#39;s location, where he stopped and dismounted. By now, there
    wasn&#39;t more than about 100 yards between them. Ernest didn&#39;t want
    any sort of gunfight with Slaughter, but he wasn&#39;t going to be taken
    back to Tombstone by that civilian, either. Slaughter, though, did
    something surprising; he sat in the shade of a small mesquite tree, leaned
    against the trunk of that tree, and just waited, staring out into the
    desert. Ernest wasn&#39;t sure what Slaughter was up to, but he knew that
    he was trapped and couldn&#39;t get away.</p>

    <p>Ernest thought about his options for a long time. He considered shooting
    it out with Slaughter, but even as old as Slaughter was Ernest didn&#39;t
    figure that he had much hope of coming out ahead in that type of fight. He
    thought about trying to climb up over the Dragoons and escaping, but the
    cliff face behind him was more than 40 feet high and he knew that even if
    he could make it up those rocks somehow he would leave his horse behind and
    that would be his death in the desert. He thought about just giving up, but
    he didn&#39;t want to spend the next 10 years in the Yuma prison for a
    measly $10 crime. Ernest was truly perplexed as he thought through his
    options.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, Slaughter simply sat under that tree, not moving, not
    drinking, not trying to talk to Ernest. In fact, at one point Ernest
    thought that Slaughter had died sitting under that tree, but then he
    swatted at a small bug flying around his head.</p>

    <p>After a few hours, Ernest decided that he had been bested and decided to
    give himself up. He called down to Texas John and told him that he was
    coming down peaceful-like, to not shoot him. Slaughter stood up, stretched,
    and watched Ernest climb down out of those rocks. Ernest grabbed the reigns
    on his horse that was hidden behind a large boulder and led the horse out
    toward Slaughter. Ernest had one fleeting thought about swinging up onto
    his horse and making a run for it, but he figured that Slaughter&#39;s
    bullets could travel faster than his horse, so he quietly gave up on that
    notion.</p>

    <p>Texas John said not a word, but simply pointed toward Tombstone about 20
    miles off to the south. Ernest understood, mounted his horse, and began to
    ride toward Tombstone with Slaughter following close behind. Though no
    words were spoken, Ernest could hear Slaughter&#39;s horse plodding along
    on the desert floor and occasionally nickering softly behind him.</p>

    <p>Several times, Ernest tried to get a conversation started with Slaughter
    just to pass the time, but Slaughter had a reputation for being a man of
    few words and he didn&#39;t seem to be in the mood to chat with Ernest.</p>

    <p>&quot;I was surprised to see you out this way. I thought you had retired
    or something.&quot; Ernest paused, but Slaughter did not respond. &quot;I
    mean, you quit law-n&#39; more than ten years ago, didn&#39;t you?&quot; No
    respose. &quot;I just don&#39;t understand why a man would go back to a
    dangerous job like that when he should be takin&#39; it easy, that&#39;s
    all I&#39;m sayin&#39;.&quot; Still, Slaughter said nothing.</p>

    <p>Ernest decided to try a different approach and said, &quot;I&#39;m right
    sorry &#39;bout robbing that man. I only got $10 from &#39;im. It
    weren&#39;t hardly worth my trouble. In fact, I still got all that money,
    and a little more, beside. What if&#39;n I give all of that to you so&#39;s
    you can give it back to that poor man. Would that make this better, you
    reckon?&quot; To his credit, Ernest wasn&#39;t trying to bribe Slaughter,
    he was smart enough to know that wouldn&#39;t work; he just hoped that
    making restitution would somehow make the crime go away. &quot;Well,
    dang-it, Slaughter, you just goin&#39; to sit there all the way in to
    Tombstone?&quot; When the only answer was the soft whinny of a horse,
    Ernest decided to just give up trying to get Texas John to talk.</p>

    <p>I suppose that the next thing Ernest done, though, could have made Texas
    John just shoot him on the spot -- he started singing. Unfortunately, he
    wasn&#39;t very good; in fact, he couldn&#39;t carry a tune in a gunny
    sack, but still he sung -- loud. He was making up the tune and the words as
    he went along. At first he sung about things like the weather and the stars
    at night, then he got onto dance hall girls and poker games; finally, he
    got to singing about his own family. I&#39;m not sure if he was hoping that
    Slaughter would tell him to stop just so he could hear another man&#39;s
    voice, but if that was his plan it didn&#39;t work. After about an hour of
    all that noise coming from Ernest Baker, he fell silent and spent the rest
    of the journey listing to the sound of the wind and the quiet plodding of
    the horses&#39; hooves on the desert floor.</p>

    <p>When they got just a few miles from Tombstone, Sheriff Hood rode out to
    meet them. As he approached, Ernest said &quot;I didn&#39;t know that Texas
    John Slaughter was still doing work for you, but he found me.&quot; As he
    said that, Ernest pumped his thumb over his shoulder to point at Slaughter.
    The sheriff gave him a long, tired look and replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know
    what you are talking about, Texas John Slaughter died in his bed in Douglas
    two days ago.&quot; Ernest&#39;s jaw dropped and his eyes opened wide. He
    turned around in his saddle and looked behind himself to a flat desert
    floor uninterrupted by anything taller than a prickly pear cactus and
    occasional mesquite tree, all the way back to the Dragoon mountains nearly
    20 miles distant.</p>

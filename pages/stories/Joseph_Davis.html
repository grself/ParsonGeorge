    <h1>Joseph Davis</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>Joseph Davis owned the Ground Hog mine about five miles south of
    Tombstone. One day in August 1884 Joe, as he liked to be called, left
    Tombstone on his horse and rode out to check on his mine. He did that
    frequently, so the miners were used to seeing him show up. Joe was known to
    be a fair owner and paid his men well but demanded that they work hard to
    earn their pay. Joe was also locally well-known for never carrying more
    than five dollars because he was afraid that a larger sum would be a
    temptation to a robber.</p>

    <p>On this particular August morning, Joe had visited the Ground Hog mine
    and then started back toward Tombstone. It was late in the afternoon and
    Joe was riding across the desert in an area that had no trails but he knew
    where he was going and he expected to be back in Tombstone well before
    dark. A short distance from the mine, though, he was ambushed by a gang of
    bandits. They stole all of his possessions, including four dollars, his
    horse, and even his clothes and boots; then they beat and stabbed him and
    left him for dead.</p>

    <p>Joe was unconscious until the middle of the night, but he was a tough
    old bird and did not die. When he came to, he was disoriented and very near
    the point of death. He couldn&#39;t remember exactly where he was or even
    what he was doing there; however, he did know that he was hurt and needed
    to get some help. He managed to get to his feet and started walking.
    Because it was a dark night, his progress was very slow. He frequently
    stepped on sharp stones and small cacti; and soon began taking only the
    smallest of tentative baby steps. Because he was disoriented, he really
    didn&#39;t even know which direction to travel; and due to his blood loss,
    he frequently fell and had to rest before proceeding. Things, frankly, did
    not look good for Joe.</p>

    <p>In his semi-conscious stupor, however, Joe heard a train whistle. He
    figured if he could just get to the tracks, he may be able to flag down a
    train, or someone riding a horse beside the tracks, and get some help. So
    Joe did the best that he could to move toward the sound of that whistle. He
    knew that he would have to hurry because once the train passed another may
    not come by for several hours, or even days. Joe made his way across the
    floor of the desert as quickly as he could, but he really wasn&#39;t very
    fast.</p>

    <p>After about an hour, Joe fell and rolled over onto his back. He was
    tired, hurt, and simply ready to give up. He looked up and saw the stars as
    they silently twinkled overhead. Joe knew that he didn&#39;t want to die,
    but he was afraid that the end was near. He heard that train whistle one
    more time and then passed out.</p>

    <p>Joe woke up but the next few hours were little more than moments of
    consciousness in a long sleepy night. He sensed being carried up the steps
    of a railroad coach. He heard a steam engine chugging slowly to his right
    and smelled the odor of burning coal. He heard men shouting things like
    &quot;let&#39;s get him aboard.&quot; Joe remembered feeling a cushioned
    seat underneath his injured body and leaning his head against the window
    where he saw the desert in the reflected light of the engine&#39;s
    headlamp. Joe felt the train gently lurch forward and then he passed out
    again.</p>

    <p>Joe&#39;s next memory was waking up on a bed in Dr. George
    Goodfellow&#39;s office in Tombstone. He had no idea how he got there but
    he knew that he was going to live. The mid-morning sun was streaming
    through a window beside his bed and Joe was looking around the room from
    his bed when the door opened and Dr. Goodfellow stepped in. He told Joe
    that he was pretty banged up but should be &quot;good as new&quot; in a few
    weeks. Joe asked how he got there and Dr. Goodfellow admitted that he
    didn&#39;t know. He had heard a knock on the door in the middle of the
    night and when he answered that knock he found Joe in a bloody heap on the
    front porch. Joe told Dr. Goodfellow he could remember being rescued by
    some men on the train and Dr. Goodfellow&#39;s response was surprising. The
    doctor said nothing, but an odd look came across his face. He reached up
    and touched Joe&#39;s forehead to check for fever, he also more thoroughly
    examined Joe&#39;s head for any injuries that he may have missed the night
    before. He then told Joe that he needed to rest and left the room.</p>

    <p>By the next day, Joe&#39;s confusion was beginning to clear and he began
    to wonder about that train. He had lived in Tombstone for several months
    and knew full well that there were no trains, or even tracks, that came to
    Tombstone. In fact, he knew that some of the local folks had opposed the
    railroad ever coming into town during a recent town hall meeting. Joe
    wondered if he had dreamed the whole affair, but that stab wound healing in
    his shoulder was real enough.</p>

    <p>Joe couldn&#39;t have known about the Ghost Train that has been reported
    throughout Cochise County since the early 1880&#39;s but it seems that his
    life was saved the night when he became a passenger on that train.</p>

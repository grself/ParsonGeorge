    <h1>Neezer</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>Several years ago, I was working on the corner of Fourth and Allen
    Street, like I usually do. It was October, one of our busiest tourism
    seasons, at about 6:30 in the evening. It was already pretty dark and the
    streets were unusually empty. Suddenly, the wind picked up and I could
    smell a sulfurous odor in the air. Shortly after that, the bell that is
    hanging on the front of the trolley depot building began to loudly ring,
    almost like a fire alarm. I looked toward the depot and saw the shadowy
    figure of a man walking toward me. He was short and rather fat, and he was
    wearing old clothes that were tattered around the wrists and ankles. He was
    wrapped in a cloak and wore a top hat. When he finally got close enough for
    me to see his face, I could immediately tell that this was not a normal
    Tombstone guest. His face was pale and lined with deep crevices, almost
    like a parched desert floor. His lips were thin and lifeless and his eyes
    were very dark.</p>

    <p>The man stepped up to me and said, &quot;Good evening. I&#39;m Neezer --
    and I&#39;m a ghost.&quot; Now, I&#39;ve seen a lot of unusual things in
    this town both on and off of my trolley tour, but this was the first time
    anyone had ever introduced himself to me as a ghost. I guessed that his
    name was short for Ebenezer or something and he continued, &quot;I came
    here to warn you about a problem we&#39;re having on the other side.
    I&#39;m the president of the Ghost Union of Tombstoneâ€¦&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;What?&quot; I interrupted, &quot;A union? You&#39;ve got to be
    kidding. Especially the &#39;Ghost Union of Tombstone.&#39; Do you realize
    that spells GUT?&quot; Neezer looked at me through his tired eyes and
    replied, &quot;Of course we know what that spells. Don&#39;t get me
    started...&quot;</p>

    <p>I replied &quot;OK. So why are the ghosts going on strike?&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;There is just plain too much work for us in this town, and
    we&#39;re all getting pretty tired. You have half a dozen ghost tours
    running every night, along with our normal work at dozens of buildings
    around town. We just need some vacation time.&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;I understand, but why did you come to me? How can I
    help?&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;The union decided that all of our ghost guides would have a
    contest and the winner would get full union support.&quot; Neezer explained
    that the goal was to have a guest say his name. Of course, the tour guide
    couldn&#39;t just tell someone to say &quot;Neezer,&quot; it had to happen
    naturally. Neezer also said that union members would be watching all of us
    carefully and if anyone broke the rules then they would be automatically
    disqualified.</p>

    <p>It was only about two days later that Neezer stopped by to see me again
    and told me that Texas Red had been disqualified when she passed a note
    with Neezer&#39;s name on it to a guest.</p>

    <p>Things went along and I kept trying to figure out how to get someone to
    say &quot;Neezer.&quot; Finally, one night we stopped at the Bufford house,
    as usual. A little girl, who was maybe only five or six years old, started
    sneezing due to an allergy. She sneezed four or five times and I mentioned
    that we seemed to have a sneezer on board that night. She innocently
    shouted out, &quot;I&#39;m your &#39;neezer.&quot; A few seconds after
    that, I heard a voice say, &quot;You win.&quot; The other guests thought
    that someone in the back of the trolley had said that for some reason, but
    I knew better.</p>

    <p>After that, I noticed a huge increase in the amount of ghost activity on
    my tour. There were numerous strange noises, including a chain rattling,
    guests were getting pictures of orbs and other manifestations, someone even
    reported that he thought he saw a white mist disappearing around the edge
    of a building.</p>

    <p>And that is why guests on my ghost tour tend to regularly get photos of
    paranormal activity, but only rarely on any other tour. And that&#39;s just
    the way things are in Tombstone, the Town Too Haunted To Die.</p>

    <h1>Pale Horse</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>No one can remember the first day the pale horse was seen in Tombstone,
    but they sure remember its last day.</p>

    <p>It was in the early spring of 1882 that the Daily Nugget mentioned in an
    article about the fast growth of the city a pale horse seen wandering
    around Tombstone. No one seemed to know where the horse came from, he just
    wandered in from the desert. He was a large horse -- tall, heavy, and
    without even one spot of color. Even his eyes were pale gray and the local
    folks got to calling him &quot;Spooky&quot; for obvious reasons. A few of
    the cowboys attempted to rope Spooky but he was very spirited and those
    attempts always ended badly, so folks mainly just left him alone.</p>

    <p>Spooky never made any noise, he never whinnied or nickered. In fact, he
    didn&#39;t even seem to make any noise as he walked and people were often
    startled when they turned and saw Spooky standing nearby staring at them.
    The story spread around town that Spooky was, in fact, a ghost horse that
    came to town looking for his rider, but since no one knew who th at rider
    may have been they didn&#39;t worry about it much. That would prove to be a
    mistake.</p>

    <p>The spring of 1882 seemed to bring a spate of untimely death, even for a
    mining boom town like Tombstone. The first was J.D. McDermott. James was an
    assayer with an office in Tombstone but from time-to-time he liked to take
    a day and ride around the mining district. He believed that his job was
    more meaningful if he could see the various claims and working mines and
    talk to both prospectors and mine owners. He would take the time to chip
    away a small ore sample from those locations for later analysis. He felt
    like he could provide a valuable service if he could assay the value of the
    ore and guide the miner&#39;s future efforts. Of course, it didn&#39;t hurt
    that he would be able to invest in those properties that seemed most likely
    to succeed. In early March, James was in the Charleston area and gently
    nudged his horse, Banjo, to cross the knee-deep San Pedro river. There must
    have been a snake or something in that water because Banjo suddenly bolted
    and James was bucked off. He hit the rocks at the edge of the river and the
    fall broke his neck and spine in three different places. A prospector was
    in the area and found James just before he died. The prospector told the
    coroner that J.D. McDermott reported seeing a pure white horse near the
    river just before his own horse bolted, but no one else had noticed a
    second horse.</p>

    <p>About a week after J.D. McDermott&#39;s death, John Martin met his
    untimely end. He was an employee of the Huachuca Water Company and was
    working on a large water line that ran from the mountains to Tombstone. He
    was about halfway between Tombstone and Charleston when he ran a test on a
    repair that he had just finished. He pulled a plug from that line and
    waited until the water started flowing. He didn&#39;t have to wait long.
    After only a few seconds the water gushed from that pipe under an
    unexpectedly great pressure. It hit a jack that John was about to put away
    and the pressure from that water drove the jack into John&#39;s chest,
    killing him instantly. Other nearby workers shut the water off as quickly
    as they could and then took John&#39;s body back to Tombs tone. They
    reported to the company officials seeing a pale, white horse standing on a
    hillside just above the water pipe while they were cleaning up after the
    accident.</p>

    <p>Spooky began to develop a reputation for being present at disasters and
    people would superstitiously shoo him away whenever they saw him. That
    didn&#39;t help little Freddy Foos. He was a boy playing in the streets of
    Tombstone one day when he saw Spooky at the end of Sixth Street near the
    mines. He ran to pet the horse but when he got close Spooky walked away.
    Freddy ran after him, calling for him to stop, pleading with the horse to
    become friends, as children do. Spooky, though, simply kept walking into
    the desert. Freddy followed, not thinking about where he was, until he
    realized that he had never been in this part of the territory before. He
    gave up on Spooky and turned to go back to Tombstone when he noticed a pipe
    with water trickling out of it near one of the mines and decided to get a
    drink. The water was clear and cool so Freddy took a long drink.
    Tragically, the mine water in Tombstone contains a high concentration of
    arsenic and Freddy had taken a fatal dose of that poison. He died a painful
    death in his mother&#39;s arms only a few hours later.</p>

    <p>Spooky was next spotted above a cliff outside Tombstone where two
    prospectors, Thomas Kearney and Simon Constatine, were blasting a small
    sample of ore out of the rock face. They were experienced prospectors and
    handling dynamite was routine work for them. They had carefully drilled a
    hole, packed it with dynamite, led the fuse away from the blast area, and
    then packed some pasty mud into the hole to seal in the dynamite. It&#39;s
    not known exactly what happened next, but they must have hit that packing
    mud too hard and set off the dynamite before they had a chance to get away.
    The blast left a shallow hole in the side of the cliff, revealing a thin
    silver lode, and killing both prospectors. Spooky had calmly watched the
    entire procedure from the cliff above and then turned and walked away.</p>

    <p>On May 22 Spooky was seen for the last time in Tombstone. Chen Li was
    building a fire under a pot of water at the Chinese laundry behind the
    Tivoli Saloon on Allen Street. She saw Spooky staring at her over the fence
    from the alley and immediately ran toward him shouting something in
    Chinese. A small breeze fanned the the flame under the pot and it ignited a
    wooden lattice used to dry clothes. The wood was desert dry and the fire
    quickly spread before it could be put out. Within a few hours more than 60
    businesses worth more than a half-million dollars were burnt to the ground.
    Fortunately, the fire took only one life, an unidentified corpse was found
    in the ashes of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. This, though, seemed to finally
    satisfy Spooky and he slowly wandered out of town into the desert and was
    never seen again in Tombstone.</p>

    <p>In early 1897, the Jerome, Arizona, newspaper, Mining News, noted a
    pale, unsaddled horse wandering down the middle of High Street. It was the
    start of a long spring for the citizens in that town.</p>

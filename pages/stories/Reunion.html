    <h1>Reunion</h1>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div id="main" class="container">

    <p>It was exactly 3:14 on October 26, 1981. Tombstone was experiencing a
    balmy 72 degree day with no clouds and a light breeze from the southwest.
    It was Monday following Helldorado weekend and most of the tourists had
    already returned to Phoenix, Tucson, and other distant homes. City
    employees were cleaning up after the busy weekend and merchants were
    inventorying their wares. A few snowbirds were already in town for the
    winter but it was, overall, a very lazy afternoon.</p>

    <p>Suddenly breaking the boredom of a perfectly mediocre day was a flash of
    light in the middle of Freemont street near Third, which was the location
    of a gunfight that took place behind the OK Corral 100 years earlier to the
    minute. A tiny wisp of smoke curled upward from a spot on the highway&#39;s
    surface and then it grew darker and bolder before it materialized into the
    specter of Virgil Earp. He was oblivious to the large truck bearing down on
    him just a few feet away since he was on a dirt road in another time
    looking for his friends and a few enemies. Virgil shouted &quot;Lookout,
    Wyatt, he&#39;s armed...&quot; then a second flash of light and wisp of
    smoke became the corporal body of Wyatt Earp, standing close beside his
    brother and staring straight into a concrete wall that was not there 100
    years back. Within moments, a dozen flashes of light and Morgan Earp, Doc
    Holliday, Billy Clayborne, and all of the others were standing in what, to
    them, was an empty lot on a chilly afternoon in Tombstone. Ike Clanton ran
    to Wyatt and begged him to not start the fight while Sheriff Behan
    threatened to arrest anyone found carrying a gun. A shot was fired, men
    began running, shouting, and firing bullets wildly into the air, hoping to
    change the outcome of that fateful day 100 years before.</p>

    <p>Then, the script changed and dozens of gunfighters began to appear in
    rapid succession all over Tombstone. These men, and a few women, were not
    present 100 years ago but had returned for this reunion to fight beside
    their kith and kin. The gunfight spilled into the alley that used to run
    behind the OK Corral and Billy Clayborn ran down that alley before turning
    toward a saloon on Allen Street. As he did, Bat Masterson appeared at the
    end of the alley and shouted something unflattering about Billy&#39;s
    retreat. Masterson then pulled his gun and began to fire. Billy fell in the
    middle of Allen Street just feet from the safety of the door and his
    friends in the Alhambra Saloon.</p>

    <p>More gunfighters appeared and the fight expanded to cover the entire
    length of 1881 Allen St. Buckskin Frank Leslie and Johnny Ringo squared off
    in front of the Oriental Saloon and a few seconds later only Leslie was
    still standing. Curly Bill Brocius and two unnamed cowboys popped up in
    front of Rafferty&#39;s Saloon and immediately afterwards Marshall White
    appeared. Angry words were exchanged before White shot Curly Bill and was
    then quickly gunned down by one of the cowboys.</p>

    <p>For about 15 minutes that afternoon, the solitude along Allen street was
    disrupted by the hammer of gunshots and also by merchants and customers
    shouting and diving for cover inside stores. Horses broke loose and ran
    wild down the streets and mis-tuned pianos in the bars burst forth with
    sudden urgency.</p>

    <p>As quickly as it had begun, it ended. The gunfighters, horses,
    merchants, and everyone else shimmered briefly in the afternoon sun, like
    the rippling of distant mountains over a hot desert road. Then, they
    disappeared into whatever world they had come from and were gone.</p>

    <p>It was just a few seconds after exactly 3:14 on October 26, 1981. A few
    of the locals on Allen Street had noticed an odd flash of light. A few
    others reported hearing a distant pop, like the backfire of an engine
    somewhere in the distance. Roy Jackson, who was sweeping the boardwalk in
    front of his restaurant, mentioned to a passing tourist that the air
    &quot;sure felt odd&quot; before he calmly returned to his task. The
    tourist then laughed that the town was as quiet as a ghost town that
    afternoon.</p>

    <p>Ten-year-old Benjamin Cooper noticed the glint of metal beneath the
    boardwalk in front of Fred King&#39;s gift shop on Allen Street. He
    squeezed his arm through a crack in the walk and managed to fish out the
    casing from an old bullet. Fred told him that finding that treasure was
    good luck and that he should hang onto it. Fred also said that the casing
    had probably fallen there from one of the gunfights during Helldorado Days
    the previous weekend; however, he couldn&#39;t explain why the casing
    appeared to be very old and somewhat corroded, like it had been lying in
    that position under that boardwalk for many years.</p>

    <p>In the end, the local folks and tourists enjoyed an unremarkable
    afternoon in a very remarkable town.</p>

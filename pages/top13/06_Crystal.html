        <p>This is said to be the sixth most haunted spot in Tombstone.</p>

        <p>One of the men who used to work at <a href=
        "../othersites/OldTombstone.html">Old Tombstone Western Theme Park</a>
        reported an incident when he was invited to join a group in the
        basement of the Crystal Palace for a ghost hunt after closing hours
        several years ago. The basement of the Crystal Palace used to connect
        to one of the mines, but that entrance was walled shut many decades
        ago. It is believed, though, that spirits from the mine still use the
        basement of the Crystal Palace as a gathering spot before visiting
        above ground, so there is a good bit of paranormal activity here. When
        the ghost hunt began, one person in the group adjusted a large machine
        sitting on a table against the mine wall that he was using to detect
        paranormal activity. At any rate, soon after the session began, the Old
        Tombstone worker heard a voice that quietly whispered in his ear
        &quot;Get Out.&quot; He said that he laughed at that voice, then it
        repeated the demand but loudly enough for the other people in the room
        to hear. When he did not move fast enough, he was pushed (or maybe
        slapped) on his back so hard that it knocked him down. He reported that
        when he got home a little later his wife noticed a huge hand print in
        the middle of his back.</p>

        <p>Bikers tend to like our town and groups frequently visit. Several
        years ago, a biker got a bit &quot;fresh&quot; with one of the women
        working at the Crystal Palace. He later went to the men&#39;s room and
        while he was washing his hands he looked in the mirror above the sink
        and noticed that a man in period costume was standing behind him. The
        biker thought that it was a great costume so he turned around to speak
        to the gentlemen, but no one was there. The biker thought that was very
        strange and he turned back to the sink to rinse his hands. When he did,
        he noticed in the mirror that gentleman was now standing just behind
        him. This time, though, the gentleman reached forward, grabbed the
        biker&#39;s shoulder, and spun him around; but there was no one there.
        The biker quickly left the building and did not come back. We know that
        Virgil Earp used to keep the peace in this place using techniques
        similar to what this biker experienced, he would physically throw
        misbehaving cowboys out onto the street and tell them to never come
        back. While we cannot know if this biker actually ran across Virgil,
        something made him leave the bar and not return. Ever.</p>

        <p class="bg-info"><strong>Tour Information</strong>: Our trolley stops
        at the corner of Fifth and Allen streets and I tell several stories
        about the history and paranormal activity associated with the buildings
        on this corner, including the Crystal Palace. This was a bloody corner
        of Tombstone and it was here that Virgil Earp was maimed on the night
        of December 28, 1881 -- his assailants were never caught, or even
        identified. It is believed that the paranormal activity experienced
        here is related to at least some of murders that took place on this
        corner.</p>

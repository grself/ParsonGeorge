180919: Nothing noted here

Writing Prompts:

What about a woman who's a witch? Mysterious things happen around her "world" and no one knows why, but one day someone discovers her secret and then there's hell to pay (maybe something like the Carrie ending???)

Someone who's a 19th century "prepper" but finds in the end that all of the preparations were for the wrong disaster.

Maybe go ahead and write the story about the "snakes from hell" hiding under the bed.

A young ghost who wants to find a new way to haunt people. How about haunting an outhouse? Maybe this could be a humorous story???
